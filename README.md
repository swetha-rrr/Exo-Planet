# Exo-Planet (Unveiling Exoplanet Insights: A Comprehensive Analysis Using Supervised Learning, Clustering, and Earth Similarity Metric)
This project applies machine learning to analyze and classify exoplanets based on their physical and orbital characteristics. It encompasses three main approaches:

Habitability Prediction: A supervised learning model that predicts the likelihood of an exoplanet being habitable using Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

Exoplanet Categorization: An unsupervised k-means clustering model that categorizes exoplanets into three types: gaseous, terrestrial, and water planets, based on key features.

Discovering Earth-Like Planets: A clustering model that identifies exoplanets with Earth-like conditions by comparing them to Earth's mass, equilibrium temperature, solar luminosity, and orbital period.

The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, with a focus on discovering potential Earth analogs. This work contributes to the ongoing search for habitable worlds beyond our solar system.
